    let num2 = num1;
    num2 = 20;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const copy1 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    copy1.push('Cheuin');

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(copy1, players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copy2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy4 = [...players];

    const copy5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    copy2.push('A');
    copy3.push('B');
    copy4.push('C');
    copy5.push('D');
    console.log(copy2, copy3, copy4, copy5, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copyObj1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 100});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const copyObj2 = {...person};
    copyObj2['age'] = 100;

    console.log(copyObj1, copyObj2, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const profile = {
        name: 'chenuin',
        age: 29,
        hobby: ['piano', 'basketball'],
    }

    const copyObj3 = {...profile};
    copyObj3['age'] = 200;
    copyObj3['hobby'][0] = 'music';
